Platy is a website where you can find cool places to skate flow. If you are visiting a city for the first time and you want to find a great place to go rollerblading then but you are not sure where to go then Platy is the way to go.
You will find not only the exact location but also a video linked to it so you get more details about the location. If you know a great place to go rollerblading and want to share it you can do it! All you have to do is sign up and once in you can locate the spot on the map, drop a pin and upload a cool video of it.
<br>
<br>
How does it work?
<ul>
<li>1. Go to the home page to find the most recet videos.</li>
<li>2. Get more details when you click on the video included the spot where it was recorded.</li>
<li>3. If you prefer you can also go to the Map section, there you can find a map with markers all over the place.</li>
<li>4. If you have some recommendation to share just sing up and go to Share your flow.</li>
<li>5. When sharing a new post you will get asked to drop a pin first so, use the map to locate the spot and click on it to drop a pin.</li>
<li>6. Once the spot has been marked you can then upload a video, this is mandatory before you get to post the new location.</li>
<li>7. The video is uploaded and the spot is located, just submit and the new location will be created.</li>
</ul>
